# Data_Structure

This repository contains basic implementations of **Data Structures** using the **C++ programming language**.  
It is created for learning, practicing, and strengthening core programming skills.

## ✅ Implemented

- 🔹 **Stack** (Array-based) implemented using **C++ Templates**
  - Fixed-size array implementation
  - Supports multiple data types via `template<typename T>`
  - Basic operations included:
    - `push()` – add an element
    - `pop()` – remove the top element
    - `Top()` – view the top element
    - `isEmpty()` – check if the stack is empty
    - `isFull()` – check if the stack is full
  - Handles edge cases like stack overflow and underflow with appropriate messages

## 🛠️ Language & Tools

- Language: **C++**
- Standard: `C++11` or higher
- Suggested editor: **VS Code**, **Code::Blocks**, or any IDE that supports C++

## 📁 Files

- `main.cpp` – contains the implementation of the Stack along with a sample test in the `main()` function

## 🚀 Future Plans

I plan to add more fundamental data structures soon, including:

- ✅ Queue (array-based and linked-list-based)
- ✅ Linked List (singly and doubly)
- ✅ Stack using `std::vector` (dynamic stack)
- ✅ Trees (Binary Tree, BST)
- ✅ Graphs

Each structure will be placed in a separate file with clear examples and usage.
